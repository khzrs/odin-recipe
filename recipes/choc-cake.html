    <p>Decadant chocolate cake with a smooth and silky buttercream smothered over the top.

        <li>200g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>200g self raising flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tsbp milk</li>
        <h3>Buttercream</h3>
        <li>100mg milk chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>200g butter, softened</li>
        <li>400g icing sugar</li>
        <li>5 tsbp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 tsbp milk</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together 200g golden caster sugar, 200g softened unsalted butter, 4 large eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, Â½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp milk and a pinch of salt until pale.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Mash 200g softened butter and 400g icing sugar together with a fork, then switch to a wooden spoon or electric beaters, if you have them.</li>
        <li>Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder with a pinch of salt and pour in the melted chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. Mix again until smooth.</li>
        <li>On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes together with half of the buttercream, then spread the rest on top. Decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.</li>
        <li>To make chocolate shards: melt 50g dark chocolate and pour it onto a tray lined with baking parchment or foil.</li>
        <li>Now melt 25g milk chocolate and 25g white chocolate and drizzle them over the dark chocolate before it sets.</li>
        <li>Shake the tray gently to level the mixture then leave to set somewhere cool. Chop into shards.</li>
    </ol>
