    <ul>
        <li>10g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>20g hot water</li>
        <li>65g ghee</li>
        <li>65g milk</li>
        <li>75g flour</li>
        <li>65g fine sugar</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking tray with oilcloth or parchment paper. Separate the eggs, put the egg yolks into a small bowl, beat the egg whites into a mixing bowl and put them in the refrigerator to refrigerate</li>
        <li>Pour hot water into the cocoa powder, stir evenly and let cool for later use</li>
        <li>Sieve and add the low flour, and use the egg to draw Z-shape to mix until there is no dry powder</li>
        <li>Pour the egg yolk into the batter, and mix well again in the same way</li>
        <li>Then prehead the oven to 310 degrees</li>
        <li>Take out the egg whites from the refrigerator, add fine sugar in 3 times, beat until medium-dry foaming, lift the egg head with a big hook</li>
        <li>Then mix the batter, first scoop 1/3 of the meringue and egg yolk paste and mix it roughly, then pour it into the remaining protein, mix well</li>
        <li>Divide 170 grams of cake batter into another pot, pour the remaining cake batter into the baking pan and spread it out</li>
        <li>Add the cocoa batter that was mixed at the beginning to 170 grams of cake batter, mix well and put it into a piping bag, then squeeze the cocoa batter on top of the original cake batter, and spread it out again</li>
        <li>Insert a stick into the cake batter at 45 degrees, and draw 6-7 back and forth horizontally and vertically in the baking pan, making sure that your fingers can touch the bottom of the baking pan every time you draw</li>
        <li>Then gently shake it flat and put it in the oven to bake for about 30-35 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the cake is out of the oven, immediately take it out and put it on a cooling rack to cool</li>
        <li>After about 10 minutes, spread a longer piece of baking paper on the cake, turn it upside down and tear off the bottom paper</li>
        <li>After the cake is cooled to warm, roll it up and set it for half an hour before slicing and enjoying</li>
    </ol>
